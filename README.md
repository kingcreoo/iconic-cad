# Iconic CAD

A pipeline for designing houses by arranging visual icons in Inkscape SVG layouts, which compile into full 3D FreeCAD models with real framing details (studs, plates, OSB sheathing).

Developed as part of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org). See the [wiki page](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Iconic_CAD_Workflow_Example) for full project context.

## Status

**Work in progress.** The core pipeline runs end-to-end but has known issues:

- Port-based compiler assembles simple rectangles correctly
- L-shaped and complex layouts partially compile — BFS traversal breaks when duplicate icons occupy the same grid cell, causing the adjacency graph to lose connectivity
- Corner inset logic produces excess wall modules that overhang at building corners
- See [open issues](https://github.com/kingcreoo/iconic-cad/issues) for details

## How it works

1. **YAML schema** defines wall module specs (lumber size, stud spacing, OSB thickness)
2. **`generate_icons.py`** produces SVG icons with metadata baked in from the YAML
3. User arranges icons on a 64px snap grid in Inkscape, rotates for orientation (0°=S, 90°=E, 180°=N, 270°=W)
4. **`compile_house.py`** parses the SVG, reads port markers from the CAD library, and assembles via graph-based BFS — works for any building shape (rectangles, L-shapes, T-shapes, etc.)

## Dependencies

```
sudo pacman -S freecad python-yaml   # Arch Linux
```

## Quick start

Generate the part library with port markers:
```bash
freecadcmd -c "import sys; sys.argv=['generate_wall_library.py','wall_instances.yaml']; exec(open('generate_wall_library.py').read())"
```

Generate SVG icons for Inkscape:
```bash
python generate_icons.py wall_instances.yaml
```

Compile a floor plan into a 3D house:
```bash
freecadcmd -c "import sys; sys.argv=['compile_house.py','examples/your_plan.svg']; exec(open('compile_house.py').read())"
```

Open the resulting `.FCStd` file in FreeCAD to view.

```

## Legacy

`legacy/compile_house_loop.py` is Marcin's original compiler which assembles walls by clustering icons into N/S/E/W runs and walking them sequentially. It works for rectangular buildings but cannot handle L-shapes, T-shapes, or other non-rectangular layouts. The current `compile_house.py` replaces this approach with port-based graph assembly.
